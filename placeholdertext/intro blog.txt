There's a long road ahead for me as a placement student at Knorr-Bremse. And what better way to document it than by starting my own blog.

The main objective of this blog is to create a repertoire of information, works, memories, goals and ideas. 
In general, here I will discuss projects I'm currently working on, though maybe not go into detail about specifics and technicalities (where unfit) as to not breach confidentiality.
Thoughts about projects, ideas for future projects and an overall insight into working here as a student at Knorr-Bremse. 
 
 Entries here will at least be weekly (unless I'm on holiday), however they may appear more frequently depending on how many projects I've got currently underway.
